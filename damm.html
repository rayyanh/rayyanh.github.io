            <h3 class="addpadportpic hotpink"  ><b>What is DAMM?</b></h3>
            <p>DAMM, or Digital Arts & Media Marketing is an organization I founded in 2017. As s student at UW Bothell, I always saw that there was not enough communication on our campus. After all, we were all mostly commuter students. In addition to this, other organizations had difficulty created media and marketing for their clubs. That is when I decided to create an agency that would serve the students initially and to empower their voices. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>During my time at DAMM, my role was very flexible and I did work in multiple different areas. As the one who started this organization with a fellow student, I did what I could to support in multiple areas. I mainly managed the entire organization with over 20 members, but I also created graphics, videos, materials for the org to use, and more. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Unfortunately, I have left DAMM. However, I will still present the impact I made that will last for as long as the organization lasts.</p>

             <h3 class="addpadportpic hotpink"><b>What else did I do?</b></h3>
            <p>I would say that about half my time was spent managing different teams. We had the executive team meetings, as well as other meeting with different organizations. I also did outreach to different organizations as well as other active stakeholders which included other clubs, campus safety, the actual UW Bothell school, and more. I also lead the documentation for DAMM becoming a non profit; which was eventually scrapped due to some unethical leadership arising. </p>

            <p><b>Club advancement (internally)</b></p>
            <p>An issue with DAMM was that we did not have enough documentation or forms to help us create a streamlined process. I spearheaded multiple different parts to this puzzle. I created forms such as the request form so that others may collaborate or request marketing materials. </p>

            <p></p>
            <p><b>Blockchain Partnership</b></p>
            <p>I led the team to obtain DAMMs first major assignment. We were able to obtain a partnership with a company called Blockchain Society NW. Due to my outreach, we were able to discuss and conduct all media based coverage for the blockchain expo. The expo was an event which had over 600 participants and was a huge success. This boosted DAMMs name. In the end, I was able to gain a sponsorship package by networking as well as find a new position under the UW Blockchain society as part of the Development & Design team as well as general leadership within the organization within that field. </p>
